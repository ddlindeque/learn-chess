### **Before You Move: A Tactical Checklist**

Before touching a single piece, it's crucial to evaluate the board. Consider this checklist to avoid blunders and spot opportunities:

* **Your Pieces:**  
  * **Hanging Pieces:** Is any of your pieces undefended and vulnerable to capture? Can you move it to safety or support it with another piece?  
  * **Pinned Pieces:** Is a piece pinned to a more valuable piece (the King or Queen)? Can you break the pin, or does moving the pinned piece expose a weakness?  
  * **Forked Pieces:** Are two of your pieces being attacked by a single enemy piece? Can you capture the forking piece or use one of the forked pieces to attack something even more valuable?  
* **Your Opponent's Pieces:**  
  * **Hanging Pieces:** Does your opponent have an undefended piece? Is there a subtle trap, or is it a free capture?  
  * **Pinned Pieces:** Has your opponent's piece been pinned? Does it give the illusion of protection for another piece?  
  * **Open Files:** Does your opponent have a move that will give them control of an open file, which can be used to attack your position?  
* **Your Opportunities:**  
  * **Check or Mate:** Can you deliver a check or, even better, a checkmate?  
  * **Fork:** Can you use one of your pieces to attack two or more of your opponent’s pieces at the same time?  
  * **Removing Protection:** Can you capture a piece that is protecting a more valuable piece, allowing you to win material on the next turn?  
  * **Open Files:** Can you gain control of an open or semi-open file with a rook, which provides a pathway for attack?  
  * **Batteries:** Can you align two of your pieces (such as two rooks or a Queen and Bishop) on a file, rank, or diagonal to create a powerful attack?  
  * **Attack:** Can you simply attack an enemy piece to gain a positional advantage?  
* **Gaining a Better Position:**  
  * **Center Control:** Are you fighting to control the center of the board with your pawns and pieces? This is crucial for mobility.  
  * **Outposts:** Can you move a piece to a forward square protected by a pawn from which it cannot be easily attacked by enemy pawns?  
  * **Passed Pawns:** Can you push a pawn to a position where there are no enemy pawns to block its path to promotion?

### **Strategic Principles by Phase**

* **Opening:** Focus on developing your pieces, getting them into active positions, and controlling the center of the board. Develop your minor pieces (knights and bishops) before your major pieces (rooks and queen). Avoid moving your queen too early, and castle your king for safety.  
* **Middlegame:** This is where the real fight begins. Create a plan to attack your opponent’s weaknesses. Use your rooks to occupy open files and create batteries to put pressure on the enemy king or other key pieces.  
* **Endgame:** The key to the endgame is to push your pawns and promote them. Use your king actively to support your pawns and threaten your opponent’s.
